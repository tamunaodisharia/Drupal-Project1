# Drupal Bootcamp - Part 1 Project Starter

This is a starter repository template for the first phase of Omedia's Drupal Bootcamp. It includes a unified repository containing a DDEV configuration and starter project code. Assignments will be provided as issues, and you will continue your work from this repository (see "Development Workflow" below).

## Setup

In the top-right dropdown "Use this template", create a new repository with the name of your choice.

Clone the repository to your local machine.

### DDev

Install DDev on your machine. [DDev Installation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installation)

Run `ddev start` in the root of the project.

Run `ddev launch` to open the project in your browser.

### Assignments

Assignments will be added to the "Drupal Bootcamp" project board, which can be found here [Drupal Bootcamp Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/Omedia/projects/23/views/2).

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for the assignment you are working on. Use the issue number in the branch name. For example;
if you are working on issue #12 and the issue is about adding a contact page, you can name your branch `GH-12-add-contact-page`;
2. Commit your changes to the branch. The commit message should be descriptive and should reference the issue number. For example, `GH-12: Add contact page`;
3. Push your branch to the repository `git push origin GH-12-add-contact-page` (for example);
4. Create a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch. The pull request should reference the issue number. For example, `GH-12: Add contact page`;
5. Assign the pull request to a team member for review, Davit Magaldadze, or Lekso Surameli;
6. Once the pull request is approved, merge it into the main branch.
